# Making Machine Learning Models Interpretable

Notebook and libraries collection on how to make all (most) of ML models interpretable. Most of the models and coding here were taken from **Interpretable Machine Learning with Python** book written by Serg Masis (2022) and **Interpretable Machine Learning** book by Christoph Molnar (2021).
